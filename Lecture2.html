        So, let’s start with the storage – there is one obvious M.2 NVMe-enabled drive. However, just beneath it, there is a SATA connector on the motherboard that is used to connect a 2.5″ drive (you can see the mounting points to the left of the M.2 SSD). Memory-wise, there is sadly only one RAM DIMM, plus 4GB of soldered memory. Yep, not the way you do a “Gaming” laptop, Lenovo, you should know best.

        <p> this is article 1.
        Here you can see the cooling system that is pretty much the same as the one on Lenovo Ideapad 330-15ICH. Additionally, the design it uses is pretty similar to the one we saw on the Acer Nitro 5 (both the new and the old one). Usually, having two heat pipes that lead to the same fans and heat sinks, however, it seems like this is working pretty nice on the Ideapad L340 Gaming (15″). What is the worst thing in this type of cooling is that the fan that is closest to the chips is doing the hard work, while the other is not being utilized to its full potential.
