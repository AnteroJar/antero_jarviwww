        <b>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by 
        implementing a markup based pattern to it.</b>
        HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
        recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), 
        the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C 
        Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the 
        latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and 
        consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. 
        HTML5 is intended to subsume 
        not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
